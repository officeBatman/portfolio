    Lately, I've been doing a lot of Python programming with NumPy.
</p>
<img src="./blog/posts/python-variables-are-by-value/views.png"/>
<p>
    One of the cool features of NumPy is that it allows you to create
    <b><em>views</em></b> of arrays. By creating a view, you can read and modify the
    original array without creating a copy.
    <br/>
    For example, if I have a matrix and I want to something with a row, I can 
    write it like this:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
# [[0. 0. 0.]
#  [0. 0. 0.]
#  [0. 0. 0.]]
matrix = np.zeros((3,3))
first_row = matrix[0, :]

# Use the first row
sum_of_row = first_row.sum()
# Update it - will be reflected in the original matrix
first_row += 1

# [[1. 1. 1.]
#  [0. 0. 0.]
#  [0. 0. 0.]]
print(matrix)
</code></pre>
<p>
    This idea can be extended to multiple dimensions too.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
matrix = np.zeros((3,3,3))
first_row = matrix[0, :, :]
first_row += 1
# the original array will be updated
</code></pre>
<p>
    Well maybe <em>row</em> is not the right term, but you get the idea.
</p>
<h2>Wow! Such A Cool And Useful Feature That Makes Your Code Robust!</h2>
<p>
    I know right?
</p>
<p>
    But the other day I was working on some code with views and refactoring
    some loops. When I finished, I ran my tests and suddenly -
    <code style="color:red">100% FAILING</code>!
</p>
<p>
    Let's figure out what happened.
    Here is an example of code that does some calculation on images. The input
    and output arrays are the images, the filters array is something related
    to image manipulation. Don't worry about what code actually does.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
for i in range(batch_size):
    for j in range(filters.shape[0]):
        for k in range(filters.shape[1]):
            filter = filters[j, k, :, :]
            image = images[i, :, :, :]
            outputs[i, k] += np.sum(filter * image[j, :, :])
</code></pre>
<p>
    Okay, so we have 3 <code> for i in range </code> loops. Let's change them
    to <code>zip</code>s. The <em><code>zip</code></em> function will iterate over the
    arrays and return views to the elements.
</p>
<p>
    Let's start with the outer loop - now the code looks like this:
</P>
<pre><code class="language-python">
for image, output in zip(images, outputs):
    for j in range(filters.shape[0]):
        for k in range(filters.shape[1]):
            filter = filters[j, k, :, :]
            output[k] += np.sum(filter * image[j, :, :])
</code></pre>
<p>
    Great! Tests are still successful. Notice the changes to the first and
    second line.
    <br/>
    Let's go over the next loop.
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
for image, output in zip(images, outputs):
    for filters_row, image_channel in zip(filters, images):
        for k in range(filters.shape[1]):
            filter = filters_row[k, :, :]
            output[k] += np.sum(filter * image_channel)
</code></pre>
<p>
    Very good, one more loop:
</p>
    <pre><code class="language-python">
for image, output in zip(images, outputs):
    for filters_row, image_channel in zip(filters, images):
        for filter, output_pixel in zip(filters_row, output):
            output_pixel += np.sum(filter * image_channel)
    </code></pre>
<p>
    And here is where I ran into the problem.
</p>
<p>
    Did you notice it already? The last for loop iterates over
    <code>zip(filters_row, output)</code> while output is a 1-dimensional array
    so iterating over it does not return a view, but a copy.
    <br/>
    That means updating <code>output_pixel</code> will not affect the original
    array, so running this code does nothing.
</p>
<p>
    ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
</p>
<h2>Why Did This Happen?</h2>
<p>
    Well I wasn't really thinking about views and I didnt notice I was creating
    zero-dimensional arrays... :P
</p>
<p>
    But the real reason is: while numpy views are by-reference, <em>python variables
    are by-value</em>.
</p>
<h2>No They're Not! In Python All Variables Are Objects! And Aren't Views Variables Too?</h2>
<p>
    Calm down, you are thinking of 2 different things.
</p>
<p>
    There are variables, which are just names, and there are
    <em>values</em>, which are things like <code>1</code>,
    <code>'hello'</code> and the thing <em>inside</em> of <code>i</code>.
    In Python, all values have reference semantics, but variables cannot be
    referenced.
</p>
<img src=".\blog\posts\python-variables-are-by-value\variable-vs-value.png"/>
<p>
    So if I declare a variable, I can modify it directly, but I cannot
    reference it with another variable.
    This might still not be clear to you, so what do I actually mean?
</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">
int a = 1;
int* x_ptr = &a;

*x_ptr += 4;

// now a == 5!
</code></pre>
<p>
    This is C code, we have a variable <code>a</code> and a pointer to it
    <code>x_ptr</code>. Here <code>a</code> is referencing the value
    <code>1</code> and <code>x_ptr</code> is referencing the <em>variable</em>
    <code>a</code>.
</p>
<img src=".\blog\posts\python-variables-are-by-value\variable-references.png"/>
<p>
    This is not something that can be achieved in Python.
</p>
<h2>But You Can Emulate It</h2>
<p>
    Right now, what we are <em>trying</em> to do is have a variable referencing
    another variable. But very often, you get caught up in a solution that you
    forget the problem. What we <em>want</em> to do is to have one reference to
    a value that is shared by multiple variables.
</p>
<p>
    A lot of people solve this by doing this:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
a = [1]
x = a

x[0] += 4

# Now a[0] == 5!
</code></pre>
<p>
    This is, in a sense, very similar to the C code we looked at earlier, if
    you think of a list as a pointer, expect both <code>x</code> and
    <code>a</code> are pointers now.
</p>
<img src=".\blog\posts\python-variables-are-by-value\lists-as-references.png"/>
<p>
    And this is basically exactly what NumPy does, the views are just values
    that reference the same array.
</p>
<h2>The Point of All This</h2>
<p>
    What I'm trying to say is that even though Python is a dynamically typed
    language that does not have any pointers, it does have references and
    copies. Languages like Python try to avoid these kind of things with
    garbage collection and classes because pointers are hard to think about,
    but they always creep into the language. Banning pointers is not a solution
    to solve bugs; The real reason questions like this get asked on
    StackOverflow is <strong>shared mutable state</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Wherever there is shared mutable data, you can expect people to be confused
    and bugs to creep in. It's just a matter of fact. There are languages that
    solve deal with this problem: They usually go for one of two solution:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            Ban sharing of mutable data. For example, in Rust, you cannot have more
            than one referece to a location in memory that is mutable.
        </p>
        <p>
            You either have many references that cannot change the value,
            or you have one reference that can.
        </p>
        <p>
            This solution is not perfect, in practice you always just abstract
            away the ristriction with things like using array indicies as
            references. But it is great for performance and familiarity.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Ban all mutable data altogether. For example, in functional
            languages like Haskell or Elm, all data is immutable.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you create a variable, that's it. Want to change it? Create a
            new one. Want to change it in a loop? Use a built in function
            instead.
        </p>
        <p>
            I prefer this solution, because it leads to less fighting with the 
            type system and cannot abstracted away.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
