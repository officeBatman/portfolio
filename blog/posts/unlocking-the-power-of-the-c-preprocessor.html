    You are probably familiar with the <code>#include</code> and
    <code>#define</code> <i>"commands"</i> in your C or C++ code. These are
    called preprocessor directives - because they are used to process the text
    before it is compiled. Today I want to explore the preprocessor,
    and show you how you can use it in weird and powerful ways.
</p>
<h2>Simple Macros</h2>
<p>
    Okay, macros. They look like functions but they are not. Here is a simple
    example of some naive macro usage:
</p>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define MAX(a,b) a &lt; b ? b : a

int getInt() {
    int i;
    scanf("%d", &i);
    return i;
}

int main() {
    printf("%d\n", MAX(0, getInt()) + 1);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    Easy, we have a program that takes some input and returns it or 0 if it was
    negative. What's the problem? First, macros simply take text arguments and
    expand their contents into the code. <code>MAX(a, b) + 1</code> expands to
    <code>a &lt; b ? b : a + 1</code> - which is not what we want
    (notice that we have <code>a + 1</code> but <code>b</code>).
    We can add parentheses to fix this:
</p>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define MAX(a,b) ((a) &lt; (b) ? (b) : (a))

int main() {
    printf("%d\n", MAX(0, getInt()) + 1);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    Cool, but we still have a problem. <code>b</code> gets replaced by
    <code>getInt()</code> twice, so we get 2 calls to <code>getInt()</code>.
    We want to get the input once, so we have to write:
</p>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define MAX(a,b) ((a) &lt; (b) ? (b) : (a))

int main() {
    int i = getInt();
    printf("%d\n", MAX(0, i) + 1);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    Now I know you understand simple macros.
    But what if we want to do something more complicated?
</p>
<h2>Macros with Macro Arguments</h2>
<p>
    Macros just take text arguments and expand their body, and we use this
    to generate code.
    <br>
    What if the code we generate uses macros itself?
</p>
<pre><code>
#define INC(X) ((X) + 1)
#define APPLY(M, ARGS) M ARGS

APPLY(INC, (5))
</code></pre>
<p>
    The last line expands correctly to <code>((5) + 1)</code>.
    You can check for yourself in <a href="https://godbolt.org/">godbolt.org</a>
    (Select a gcc compiler and enter <em>"-E"</em> where it says
    "Compiler Options").
</p>
<p>
    Cool! Macros can use macros.
</p>
<p>
    Let's try one more thing, can we use <code>APPLY</code> with itself?
</p>
<pre><code>
#define INC(X) ((X) + 1)
#define APPLY(M, ARGS) M ARGS

APPLY(APPLY, (INC, (5)))
</code></pre>
<p>
    Surprisingly, this expands into <code>APPLY (INC, (5))</code>,
    and not to <code>((5) + 1)</code>.
    Why didn't the <code>APPLY</code> expand like
    <code>INC</code> in the previous example?
</p>
<h2>Painting with Macros üé®üñå</h2>
<p>
    What happens when a macro is expanded?
</p>
<p>
    First, it's arguments are expanded.
    <br>
    Second, the preprocessor creates a <em>disabling context</em>
    and adds the current macro. I'll explain this later.
    <br>
    Then the preprocessor scans it's body, token by token,
    and adds them to the text.
    When it finds an identifier token, it does one of 2 things:
    <ol>
        <li>
            If the identifier is in the <em>disabling context</em>,
            it gets disabled
            and added to the text as is.
            This is called being
            <em blue>painted blue</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            If the identifier
            is <strong>not</strong> in the <em>disabling context</em>,
            was <strong>not</strong>
            <em blue>painted blue</em>,
            and can be expanded, it gets expanded and added to the text.
            It's disabling context will contain itself, along with everything
            in the current disabling context.
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    The disabling context is a way to keep macros from expanding forever - 
    It's just a mechanism to block recursion.
    <br>
    It's a stack of macros that are currently being expanded, so should not be
    expanded again.
</p>
<p>
    Once a macro call has been <em blue>painted blue</em>,
    it cannot be expanded <em>forever</em> üíô.
</p>
<p>
    Alright, so it seems recursion is a no go. What can we do to make it work?
</p>
<h3>Recursion Anyway üîÅ</h3>
<p>
    Idea - Let's try to use a macro to expand itself recursively, without
    having it appear inside of itself.
</p>
<p>
    We want to have a macro <code>A</code> call some macro <code>B</code>
    that will expand <code>A</code>.
</p>
<pre><code>
#define EMPTY
#define A() a was called! B EMPTY ()
#define B() b was called! A()

A()
</code></pre>
<p>
    This is close to what I mean. We have <code>A</code> that expands
    to <code>a was called! B()</code>
    (because <code>EMPTY</code> expands to nothing)
    So after <code>A</code> expanded, B is expandable and should expand
    to
    <code>
        b was called! a was called!
        <span blue>B</span>()
    </code>
    <br>
</p>
<p>
    The problem - it doesn't.
</p>
<p>
    After passing through all of <code>A</code>'s body,
    B just stays there. It won't expand on it's own.
    But we do have a solution:
</p>
<h2>Using <code>EVAL</code></h2>
<p>
    We want to define a macro that will force it's arguments to expand.
</p>
<pre><code>
#define EVAL0(...) __VA_ARGS__
#define EVAL1(...) EVAL0 (EVAL0 (EVAL0 (__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL2(...) EVAL1 (EVAL1 (EVAL1 (__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL3(...) EVAL2 (EVAL2 (EVAL2 (__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL4(...) EVAL3 (EVAL3 (EVAL3 (__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL(...)  EVAL4 (EVAL4 (EVAL4 (__VA_ARGS__)))
</code></pre>
