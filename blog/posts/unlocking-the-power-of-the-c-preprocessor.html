    You are probably familiar with the <code>#include</code> and
    <code>#define</code> <i>"commands"</i> in your C or C++ code. These are
    called preprocessor directives - because they are used to process the text
    before it is compiled. Today I want to explore <code>#define</code>
    and show you how you can use it in weird and powerful ways.
</p>
<h2>Simple Macros</h2>
<p>
    Okay, macros. They look like functions but they are not. You usually want to
    use them to generate code instead of writing it yourself.
</p>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define GENERATE_CMP_FUNCTION(name, type) \
    type name(type a, type b) { \
        return a &lt; b ? -1 : a &gt; b ? 1 : 0; \
    }

GENERATE_CMP_FUNCTION(cmp_int, int)
GENERATE_CMP_FUNCTION(cmp_float, float)

/*
 * Now the following functions have been generated:
 * int cmp_int(int a, int b);
 * float cmp_float(float a, float b);
 */

int main() {
    printf("%d\n", cmp_int(1, 2));
    printf("%d\n", cmp_float(1.0, 2.0));
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<!--
<p>
    Here is a simple example of some naive macro usage:
</p>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define MAX(a,b) a &lt; b ? b : a

int getInt() {
    int i;
    scanf("%d", &i);
    return i;
}

int main() {
    printf("%d\n", MAX(0, getInt()) + 1);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    Easy, we have a program that takes some input and returns it or 0 if it was
    negative. What's the problem? First, macros simply take text arguments and
    expand their contents into the code. <code>MAX(a, b) + 1</code> expands to
    <code>a &lt; b ? b : a + 1</code> - which is not what we want
    (notice that we have <code>a + 1</code> but <code>b</code>).
    We can add parentheses to fix this:
</p>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define MAX(a,b) ((a) &lt; (b) ? (b) : (a))

int main() {
    printf("%d\n", MAX(0, getInt()) + 1);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    Cool, but we still have a problem. <code>b</code> gets replaced by
    <code>getInt()</code> twice, so we get 2 calls to <code>getInt()</code>.
    We want to get the input once, so we have to write:
</p>
<pre><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define MAX(a,b) ((a) &lt; (b) ? (b) : (a))

int main() {
    int i = getInt();
    printf("%d\n", MAX(0, i) + 1);
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>
    Now I know you understand simple macros.
    But what if we want to do something more complicated?
</p>
-->
<h2>Macros with Macro Arguments</h2>
<p>
    Macros just take text arguments and expand their body, and we use this
    to generate code.
    <br>
    What if the code we generate uses macros itself?
</p>
<pre><code>
#define INC(X) ((X) + 1)
#define APPLY(M, ...) M (__VA_ARGS__)

APPLY(INC, 5)
</code></pre>
<p>
    The last line expands correctly to <code>((5) + 1)</code>.
    You can check for yourself in <a href="https://godbolt.org/">godbolt.org</a>
    (Select a gcc compiler and enter <em>"-E"</em> where it says
    "Compiler Options").
</p>
<p>
    Cool! Macros can use macros.
</p>
<p>
    Let's try one more thing, can we use <code>APPLY</code> with itself?
</p>
<pre><code>
#define INC(X) ((X) + 1)
#define APPLY(M, ...) M (__VA_ARGS__)

APPLY(APPLY, INC, 5)
</code></pre>
<p>
    Surprisingly, this expands into <code>APPLY (INC, 5)</code>,
    and not to <code>((5) + 1)</code>,
    and the compiler complains about a syntax error.
    Why didn't the <code>APPLY</code> expand like
    <code>INC</code> in the previous example?
</p>
<h2>Painting with Macros üé®üñå</h2>
<p>
    What happens when a macro is expanded?
</p>
<p>
    As the preprocessor reads the code, token by token, it makes a list of
    macros that should not be expanded again - this way it bans recursion.
    <br> This list is called <span class=highlight>the disabling context</span>.
    <br> Inside it it keeps track of macros that are expanded, and when a macro
    is done expanding it removes it from the disabling context.
</p>
<p>
    When the preprocessor encounters a macro that is currently in the disabling
    context, it <em blue>paints it blue</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Once a macro call has been <em blue>painted blue</em>,
    it cannot be expanded <em>forever</em> üíô.
</p>
<h3>Step By Step Explanation</h3>
<p>
    Let's explain this with an example.
</p>
<pre><code>
#define INC(X) ((X) + 1)
#define APPLY(M, ...) M (__VA_ARGS__)
#define F(M) APPLY(M, 5)

APPLY(F, INC)
</code></pre>
<p>
    The preprocessor starts by expanding the <code>APPLY</code> macro.
    It adds it to the disabling context, and now looks at it's body:
</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">
F(INC) // disabled: APPLY
</code></pre>
<p>
     Then this <code>F(INC)</code> is expanded. <code>F</code> gets added to
     the disabling context, and we have:
</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">
APPLY(INC, 5) // disabled: F, APPLY
</code></pre>
<p>
    Inside it's body, <code>APPLY</code> and <code>F</code> are disabled.
    It marks <code>APPLY</code> blue, and now it is done. We are left with a final expansion
    of:
</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">
<em blue>APPLY</em>(INC, 5) // disabled: nothing
</code></pre>
<p>
    Note that now that it finished expanding <code>APPLY</code> and <code>F</code>,
    it removed them both from the disabling context.
</p>
<p>
    The disabling context is a way to keep macros from expanding forever - 
    It's just a mechanism to block recursion.
    <br>
    It's a stack of macros that are currently being expanded, so should not be
    expanded again.
</p>
<p>
    Alright, so it seems recursion is a no go. What can we do to make it work?
</p>
<h3>Recursion Anyway üîÅ</h3>
<p>
    Idea - Let's try to use a macro to expand itself recursively, without
    having it appear inside of itself.
</p>
<p>
    What do I mean by this? I'm talking about a macro that <em>defers</em> the
    recursive call to itself to after it has been removed from the
    disabling context.
</p>
<pre><code>
#define EMPTY
#define A() a was called! B EMPTY ()
#define B() b was called! A()

A()
</code></pre>
<p>
    This is close to what I mean. We have <code>A</code> that expands
    to <code>a was called! B()</code>
    (because <code>EMPTY</code> expands to nothing)
    So after <code>A</code> gets expanded, B is expandable and should expand
    to
    <code>
        b was called! a was called!
        <span blue>B</span>()
    </code>
    <br>
</p>
<p>
    The problem - it doesn't.
</p>
<p>
    After passing through all of <code>A</code>'s body,
    <code>B</code> just stays there. It won't expand on it's own.
    But we do have a solution:
</p>
<h2>Using <code>EVAL</code></h2>
<p>
    We want to define a macro that will force it's arguments to expand.
</p>
<pre><code>
#define EVAL0(...) __VA_ARGS__
#define EVAL1(...) EVAL0 (EVAL0 (EVAL0 (__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL2(...) EVAL1 (EVAL1 (EVAL1 (__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL3(...) EVAL2 (EVAL2 (EVAL2 (__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL4(...) EVAL3 (EVAL3 (EVAL3 (__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL(...)  EVAL4 (EVAL4 (EVAL4 (__VA_ARGS__)))
</code></pre>
<p>
    This is usually about how <code>EVAL</code> is defined, it takes a list of
    arguments and passes them through a bunch of macro calls and returns them
    as is. If we now write:
</p>
<pre><code>
EVAL(A())
</code></pre>
<p>
    It expands to <code>a was called! b was called! a was called! B()</code>.
    <br> Great! <code>A</code> called itself.
    <br> If we now write:
</p>
<pre><code>
#define EMPTY

#define A() a was called! B EMPTY ()
#define B() b was called! A EMPTY ()

#define EVAL0(...) __VA_ARGS__
#define EVAL1(...) EVAL0 (EVAL0 (EVAL0 (__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL2(...) EVAL1 (EVAL1 (EVAL1 (__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL3(...) EVAL2 (EVAL2 (EVAL2 (__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL4(...) EVAL3 (EVAL3 (EVAL3 (__VA_ARGS__)))
#define EVAL(...)  EVAL4 (EVAL4 (EVAL4 (__VA_ARGS__)))

EVAL(A())
</code></pre>
<p>
    We get:
</p>
<pre><code>
a was called! b was called! a was called! b was called!
 a was called! ... a was called! B ()
</code></pre>
<p>
    That's about <em>182</em> <code>a was called! b was called!</code>'s
    followed by a single <code>a was called! B ()</code>.
</p>
<p>
    <em>recursion</em>.
</p>
<p>
    This EVAL is like a recursion expander
    with around 182 as the maximum recursion depth.
    But you can easily expand it to a higher depth.
</p>
<h2>Conditional Expansion üí™</h2>
<p>
    This is the the real power house that will allow us to do insane things.
</p>
<p>
    We'll start with a seemingly simple macro:
</p>
<pre><code>
#define CAT(A, ...) CAT_INNER(A, __VA_ARGS__)
#define CAT_INNER(A, ...) A ## __VA_ARGS__
</code></pre>
<aside>
    <p>
        This uses <code>##</code> - the token concatenation operator.
        It's a way to concatenate two tokens together.
    </p>
</aside>
<p>
    This is a macro that takes two arguments, and returns the concatenation
    of the two. Because it uses <code>...</code> it can also take only one
    argument and just return it. You don't want to use it with three or more
    arguments.
</p>
<p>
    So <code>CAT(A, B)</code> expands to <code>AB</code>.
    Becuase it first delegates to <code>CAT_INNER</code>, if <code>A</code>
    or <code>B</code> are macros themselvs, they will expand.
</p>
<p>
    Now I want to define together a simple logical operator - Not!
</p>
<pre><code>
#define NOT(X) CAT(NOT_, X)
#define NOT_0 1
#define NOT_1 0
</code></pre>
<p>
    This is a macro that takes a single argument, and returns the logical
    negation of that argument. But it only works with 0 and 1.
</p>
<p>
    The following macro will work on any argumentO
</p>
<pre><code>
#define NOT(X) SECOND_OR_0(CAT(NOT_, X))
#define SECOND_OR_0(...) SECOND(__VA_ARGS__, 0, 0)
#define SECOND(A, B, ...) B
#define NOT_0 ~, 1
</code></pre>
<p>
    This is pretty complicated, but I think the best way to understand how this
    works is with an example. Here are the expansions of
    <code>NOT</code> with some arguments:
</p>
<pre><code class=nohighlight>
NOT(0)
SECOND_OR_0(NOT_0)
SECOND_OR_0(~, 1)
SECOND(~, 1, 0, 0)
1

NOT(1)
SECOND_OR_0(NOT_1)
SECOND(NOT_1, 0, 0)
0

NOT(what ever)
SECOND_OR_0(NOT_what ever)
SECOND(NOT_what ever, 0, 0)
0
</code></pre>
<p>
    This is powerful. Let's make an if now:
</p>
<pre><code>
#define IF(COND) CAT(IF_, NOT(NOT(COND)))
#define IF_1(T, ...) T
#define IF_0(T, ...) __VA_ARGS__
</code></pre>
<p>
    This takes a condition, and returns a macro that returns the first argument
    if the condition is true,
    and the second argument if the condition is false.
    The second argument can be omitted because we used <code>...</code>.
    We also used <code>NOT(NOT(COND))</code> to force the condition to be
    either 0 or 1.
</p>
<p>
    Now we can use it to define every logical operator:
</p>
<pre><code>
#define AND(X, Y) IF(X) (Y, 0)
#define OR(X, Y) IF(X) (1, Y)
#define XOR(X, Y) IF(X) (NOT(Y), Y)
</code></pre>
<p>
    Yep, that's right. This means that the C preprocessor is
    <span class=highlight>turing comlete</span>.
    I encourage you to try it out to see that it works, but I know this is
    already a long read. I'l just show you one last thing.
</p>
<h2>Repeatition</h2>
<p>
    I'll show you how conditional expansion and recursion fit together.
</p>
<p>
    First let's make something that decrements a number.
</p>
<pre><code>
#define DEC(N) CAT(DEC_, N)
#define DEC_0 0
#define DEC_1 0
#define DEC_2 1
#define DEC_3 2
#define DEC_4 3
#define DEC_5 4
#define DEC_6 5
#define DEC_7 6
#define DEC_8 7
#define DEC_9 8
#define DEC_10 9
</code></pre>
<p>
    This takes a number and conditional expands to the one bellow, stopping at
    0 because we don't want to go lower. Now, for the real thing:
</p>
<pre><code>
#define REPEAT(MACRO, N)                             \
    IF(N) (REPEAT_INNER, EAT) EMPTY (MACRO, DEC(N))  \
    IF(N) (MACRO, EAT) EMPTY (N)
#define REPEAT_INNER(MACRO, N) REPEAT EMPTY (MACRO, N)
#define EAT(...)
</code></pre>
<p>
    We have a macro <code>REPEAT</code> that takes a macro argument and a number.
    If that number is not zero, it calls <code>REPEAT</code> again and calls
    the macro. <br>
    Notice how we used the <code>EMPTY</code> and the <code>REPEAT_INNER</code>
    trick to use recursion like in the beginning.
</p>
<p>
    The equivalent Python code would be:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">
def repeat(f, n):
    if n != 0:
        repeat(f, n - 1)
    if n != 0:
        f(n)
</code></pre>
<p>
    This is a loop! With only macros!
</p>
<p>
    You can use this to 
</p>
