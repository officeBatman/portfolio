        <h1>Python Variables Are By-Value</h1>
        <a href="../index.html">Index</a>
        <p>
            Lately, I've been doing a lot of Python programming with NumPy.
            
            <br>
            
            One of the cool features of NumPy is that it allows you to create
            <i>views</i> of arrays.
            
            <br>

            For example, if I have a matrix and I want to modify a row, I can 
            write this:
            <code>
                matrix = np.zeros((3,3))
                first_row = matrix[0, :]
                first_row += 1
            </code>
            This increments every element in the first row!

            <br>

            This idea can be extended to multiple dimensions too.
            <code>
                matrix = np.zeros((3,3,3))
                first_row = matrix[0, :, :]
                first_row += 1
            </code>
            Well maybe <i>row</i> is not the right term, but you get the idea.

            <br>

            <h2>Wow! Such A Cool And Useful Feature That Makes Your Code Robust!</h2>

            I know right?

            But the other day I was turning some <code>for i in range</code> loops
            into zips on numpy arrays using views for efficiency - when I finished
            I ran my tests and suddenly - <code>100% FAILING</code>!

            <br>

            Turns I was <i>"fixing"</i> this loop:
            <code>
                for i in range(len(outputs)):
                    outputs[i] += image * filters[i]
            </code>
            into this:
            <code>
                for filter, output in zip(filters, outputs):
                    output += image * filter
            </code>

            ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

            <br>

            Well when you show it like this it's obvious, but yeah that code is
            not the same as the original. (notice how im not actually changing
            the array)

            <br>

            <h2>Why Did This Happen?</h2>

            Well I was thinking about NumPy views and I didnt notice I was looking
            at a 0-dimensional array... :P

            <br>
            
            Basically, while numpy views are <i>by-reference</i>, python variables
            are <i>by-value</i>.

            <h2>No They're Not! In Python All Variables Are Objects! And Aren't Views Variables Too?</h2>

            Calm down, you are thinking of 2 different things.

            <br>

            There are variables, which are just names, and there are
            <i>values</i>, which are things like <code>1</code>,
            <code>'hello'</code> and the thing <i>inside</i> of <code>i</code>.
